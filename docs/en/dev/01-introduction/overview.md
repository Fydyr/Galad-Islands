# ğŸ“š Galad Islands â€” Technical Introduction

This document is the technical introduction and overview for the Galad Islands project. It is intended for developers, contributors and maintainers who need a concise, practical view of the codebase, architecture and how to get started.

## Purpose

- Explain the project goals and high-level architecture
- Provide a quick-start to run and develop the game locally
- Point to detailed API and system documentation

## High-level overview

Galad Islands is a small real-time strategy / tactics game implemented in Python. The codebase follows an Entity-Component-System (ECS) design (using the `esper` library) to keep game data and logic modular and testable. Rendering and input are handled with `pygame`.

Key subsystems

- Game engine: main loop, orchestration and lifecycle
- ECS components & systems: data-only components, processors that execute game logic
- UI subsystem: Action bar, shop and debug UI
- Managers: audio, sprite management, events, configuration
- Tools: small utilities and a config editor (`tools/galad_config.py`)

## Quick start (developer)

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fydyr/Galad-Islands.git
cd Galad-Islands
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (Linux/macOS):

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

4. Run the game:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Contributing & support

- Use the `unstable` branch for in-progress work and open PRs against `main` when ready.
- Follow the Conventional Commits rules documented in `docs/en/dev/07-annexes/contributing.md`.
- For quick help, open an issue or a discussion on GitHub.
