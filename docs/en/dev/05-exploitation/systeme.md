# Critical System Settings - Galad Islands

These parameters define the minimum and optimal constraints of the **Pygame**-based game engine.
They ensure stable operation, correct responsiveness, and a smooth experience.

| Parameter | Description | Default Value | Critical Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Display Resolution** | Dimensions of the game window (width × height in pixels). | `1168 × 629` | Directly affects GPU/CPU load and interface readability. |
| **Target Framerate** | Target number of frames per second. | `30 FPS` | Determines gameplay fluidity and CPU consumption. |
| **Map Size** | Logical dimensions of the world (in tiles). | `45 × 45 tiles` | Memory impact (3600 tiles = tileset, collisions, pathfinding). |
| **Tile Size** | Dimension of a map tile in pixels (dynamically calculated). | `16-64 px` (adaptive) | Impacts rendering performance and texture memory. |
| **VSync** | Vertical synchronization. | `true` | Limits framerate to monitor frequency, reduces tearing and CPU/GPU consumption. Configurable in settings. |
| **Performance Mode** | Automatic performance optimization mode. | `auto` | Automatically adjusts visual settings based on system capabilities (auto/high/medium/low). |
| **Particles** | Display of visual particle effects. | `true` | Enables/disables visual effects (explosions, trails). GPU performance impact. |
| **Shadows** | Display of unit shadows. | `true` | Enables/disables shadow effects. Rendering performance impact. |
| **Audio System** | Sampling rate and channel management. | Pygame default | Influences sound quality and memory usage. |
| **Camera Speed** | Camera movement in pixels per second. | `200 px/s` | Determines scrolling responsiveness and rendering calculation load. |
| **Zoom** | Available zoom range. | `0.25 - 2.5` (step: `0.1`) | Direct impact on the number of entities to render and GPU load. |

## Adaptive Display Constraints

The engine automatically calculates the optimal tile size to ensure minimum visibility and stable performance:

| Constraint | Value | System Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Min visible tiles (width)** | `15` | Ensures readability and limits the number of simultaneously rendered objects. |
| **Min visible tiles (height)** | `10` | Same vertically. Optimal ratio for 16:9 screens. |
| **Min tile size** | `16 px` | Lower limit to avoid illegibility and excessive aliasing. |
| **Max tile size** | `64 px` | Upper limit to control texture memory usage and sprite size. |

## Procedural Map Generation

These rates control entity density and impact performance (collisions, pathfinding, AI):

| Element | Rate | Number of instances (60×60) | System Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mines** | 2% | `72` | Static collisions, danger zone. |
| **Generic Islands** | 1% | `36` | Navigation obstacles, pathfinding calculations. |
| **Clouds** | 3% | `108` | Visual elements, low impact (no collision). |

**Total static entities**: ~216 objects on 3600 tiles (6%)

## Supported Resolutions

The engine natively supports these resolutions without costly recalculations:

| Resolution | Calculated Tile Size | Ratio |
|---|---|---|
| 800×600 | 40 px | 4:3 |
| 1024×768 | 62 px | 4:3 |
| 1280×720 | 62 px | 16:9 |
| 1366×768 | 62 px | ~16:9 |
| 1920×1080 | 64 px (max) | 16:9 |
| 2560×1440 | 64 px (max) | 16:9 |

Resolutions ≥1920×1080 reach the max limit of 64px per tile, thus optimizing GPU usage. <br/>
It is also possible to modify the resolutions in the settings to have custom resolutions.

### Technical Characteristics
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 (multilingual support)
- **Validation**: Min/max ranges applied on load
- **Fallback**: Default values if file is corrupt/missing
- **Merge**: Smart merge with defaults to avoid config loss

---

## Allowed Value Ranges

These limits prevent unstable configurations:

| Parameter | Min | Max | Unit |
|---|---|---|---|
| **screen_width** | 200 | 10000 | pixels |
| **screen_height** | 200 | 10000 | pixels |
| **volume_*** | 0.0 | 1.0 | ratio |
| **camera_sensitivity** | 0.1 | 5.0 | Multiplier |
| **camera_fast_multiplier** | 1.0 | ∞ | Multiplier |

---

## Configurable Performance Settings

These parameters allow users to adjust performance according to their preferences and hardware capabilities:

### Performance Mode

| Mode | Description | CPU/GPU Impact | Visual Quality |
|------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Auto** | Automatic adjustment based on detected capabilities | Adaptive | Optimized |
| **High** | Maximum quality, all effects enabled | High | Maximum |
| **Medium** | Balanced performance/quality | Medium | Good |
| **Low** | Maximum performance, reduced effects | Low | Minimal |

### Visual Effects Management

- **Particles**: Controls display of particle effects (explosions, projectile trails)
- **Shadows**: Enables/disables unit and building shadows
- **VSync**: Vertical synchronization to prevent screen tearing

These settings are accessible via the in-game **Options** menu (Escape key) or the external tool `tools/galad_config.py`.

## Optimization Notes

1. **30 FPS Framerate**: A deliberate choice to balance fluidity and CPU consumption on modest hardware.

2. **Adaptive Tile Size**: Avoids over-rendering at high resolution and maintains readability at low resolution.

3. **VSync by default**: Reduces unnecessary load by limiting the framerate to the monitor's capacity (usually 60Hz).

4. **30×30 Map**: Modest size (900 tiles) to ensure stable performance for pathfinding and collisions.

5. **8% Object Density**: Balances visual richness and performance of spatial algorithms.
