## üó∫Ô∏è Territorial Control and Strategy

### Islands: Strategic Centers

**Role of Islands**: Islands are the key points of territorial control. They allow you to:

- **Build towers**: Automatic defense and healing
- **Collect resources**: Gold appears periodically
- **Control routes**: Block enemy movements

### Construction System

**Defense Towers** (150 gold):

- **HP**: 300 | **Damage**: 25 | **Range**: 350
- Automatically attacks nearby enemies
- Reload: 1 second between shots

**Healing Towers** (120 gold):

- **HP**: 200 | **Healing**: 10 HP | **Range**: 350
- Automatically regenerates nearby allies
- Reload: 1 second between heals

**Construction**:

1. Select an Architect
2. Click on "Defense Tower" or "Healing Tower" in the action bar
3. Click on an empty island to place the tower
4. Only one tower per island possible

### Territorial Expansion

#### Phase 1 (0-3 min): Securing

- Control 2-3 islands near your base
- Establish stable economy via chests
- Place minimal defense tower

#### Phase 2 (3-6 min): Development

- Expand towards strategic islands
- Build coordinated defensive network
- Maintain economic pressure

#### Phase 3 (6+ min): Domination

- Control the majority of islands
- Overwhelming economic superiority
- Impenetrable defense

### Adaptive Strategies

**Against Early Attacks**:

1. Immediately build a defense tower near the base
2. Group your units in defensive position
3. Use terrain (islands) as cover

**Against Enemy Economy**:

1. Constantly harass their chest sources
2. Control resource-rich islands
3. Launch raids on their supply lines

**Against Defensive Strategy**:

1. Peripheral expansion to bypass
2. Economic superiority to overwhelm
3. Victory by economic asphyxiation

## üå´Ô∏è Fog of War and Vision (Beta Version)

**‚ö†Ô∏è This feature is currently in development and available only in the game's beta version.**

### Fog of War Principles

Fog of war transforms each game into a strategic dance between shadow and light:

#### Zone States

- **Thick fog**: Unexplored territories, potentially rich in hidden resources
- **Gray mist**: Areas already discovered but currently out of sight
- **Clear vision**: Territories under active control of your team

### Vision Strategies

#### Aggressive Exploration

**Objective**: Quickly discover the map

- Use **Scouts** to extend your field of vision
- Create dedicated "exploration patrols"
- Prioritize strategic islands for resources

#### Defensive Vision

**Objective**: Protect your positions

- Place sentinel units around your bases
- Use tower vision to cover approaches
- Create "surveillance zones" around vital points

#### Psychological Warfare

**Objective**: Manipulate enemy perception

- Hide your movements behind your opponent's reduced vision
- Create diversions in visible areas
- Use the element of surprise for your attacks

### Tactical Advantages of Fog

#### Ambushes and Surprises

- Position units in non-visible areas
- Attack enemy resource convoys
- Set traps for enemy explorers

#### Resource Management

- Protect your gold collectors from surprise raids
- Intercept flying chests before the enemy
- Hide your defensive constructions

#### Psychological Pressure

- Force the opponent to maintain lighting units
- Create the illusion of a larger presence
- Sow doubt about your true intentions

### Tips for Mastering Fog

#### Tips for Mastering Fog

#### Methodical Exploration

1. **Start local**: Secure your starting zone
2. **Expand gradually**: Advance island by island
3. **Prioritize resources**: Look for visible gold first
4. **Maintain pressure**: Don't let the enemy explore freely

#### Optimal Unit Usage

- **Scouts**: Elite units for exploration and ambushes
- **Marauders**: Mobile defenders to protect flanks
- **Leviathans**: Firepower to secure positions
- **Druids**: Support to maintain vision on key points
- **Architects**: Tower construction to extend passive vision

#### Risk Management

- Always maintain a "visual reserve" of units
- Avoid stretching too far across the map
- Use special abilities to gain temporary advantages
- Stay vigilant against enemy invisible movements

**Note:** The vision system is constantly evolving. Your feedback on the beta version is valuable for refining this strategic mechanic!
