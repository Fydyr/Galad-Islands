## 🎓 In-game Tutorials

In-game tutorials help you learn the core mechanics and interface during your first session. They appear as small notifications in the top-right corner: a short title, a brief message, and two buttons — **Next** and **Skip**.

- Tutorials are contextual: they appear when important game events happen (game start, unit selection, opening the shop, spotting enemies, collecting a chest or island resource, etc.).
- By default, each tip shows only once.
- If several events happen at once, tips are queued; higher-priority tips (for example the welcome message or unit selection) are shown first.
- Tutorials do not appear in Spectator mode (AI vs AI).

How to manage tutorials:

- Open **Options** → **Gameplay**.
- Use **Show tutorials** to toggle all tutorials on or off.
- Use **Reset tutorials** to see the tips again (useful if you skipped them accidentally).

If a tutorial shows too early or too frequently, it might be linked to a game event — please report it and we'll adjust the trigger.
