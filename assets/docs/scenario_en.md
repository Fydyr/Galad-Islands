# Context

For centuries, the islands of Galad have floated in the sky, suspended between magical winds and eternal clouds. These islands harbor rare resources: Aerion Crystal, capable of powering flying ships and granting colossal power to its bearer. For long, a fragile balance reigned between adventurers and the mystical creatures of the skies. But the thirst for power and fear of disappearing broke this truce.

## War Outbreak

When the mages of the Dawn Fleet discovered a new vein of Aerion Crystal beneath a Galad island, the monsters of the Abyss Legion attacked without waiting, judging that humanity would enslave the sky and destroy the millennial balance.

The attack was brutal: flying ships in flames fell into the clouds, cannons emerged above floating cities, and entire islands were besieged. Since that day, each faction tries to take control of the Galad islands.

The conflict culminates around two fortresses. The "Eryndor" Fortress belongs to the Dawn Fleet and the "Barakdur" Fortress belongs to the Abyss Legion, the greatest aerial bastion of the Galad islands. Whoever manages to besiege and destroy the enemy fortress will dominate not only the islands, but also the entire sky of the world.
